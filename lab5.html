               I love trying creative outlets in all forms!</br>
               Currently, I am teaching myself how to draw, and paint. I love to sing, and I love to dance even tho I am not good at it, at all.</br>
               I crochet, and sew; Fibre arts are just as valuable as traditional or digital media!</br>
               I love writing in my journals, (yes, plural) and reading books about nueroplasticity and holisitic practices.</p>

			Nature! I have a ton of house plants, they are my children. My life. </br>
			Creative expression is something that is very important to me; and should be to You as well! </br>
            <strong>DISLIKES:</strong> nasty people.... lol. I'm working towards being more compassionate to people with ugly attitudes.</br>
                The color yellow.. it's disgusting.</br>
                Repetitive/annoying sounds, and I hate eating vegetables.</p>
